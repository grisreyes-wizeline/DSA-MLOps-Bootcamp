# I. General Information
The **Machine Learning Operations Bootcamp** is carefully designed to help participants better understand the efficient management and deployment of machine learning models in real-world contexts. It covers topics ranging from the fundamental principles of machine learning to the intricacies of model deployment and monitoring.

In this training, participants will gain **essential knowledge and skills** for the smooth execution of machine-learning projects in production environments. Participants will **integrate the expertise of four distinct technological profiles**: Data Science, Data Engineering, Systems Reliability Engineering, and Software Engineering.

At the end of this learning journey, within their role, they will be ready to work **collaboratively, optimize model performance, ensure data reliability, and maintain system efficiency throughout the project lifecycle**.

# V. Mentoring Model
Mentorship sessions are designed to help participants address questions about the content and receive support for their projects. They are a valuable tool for receiving guidance from our experts in the four profiles.

The mentorship period for this bootcamp is from **January 24 to May 17, 2024**, and **three approaches** are being implemented.

# 1. Slack/Forum: #foro-mlops-bootcamp
- A channel dedicated to resolving doubts about the content.
- In this space, everyone can respond. 
- The team of instructors and mentors must monitor and respond to questions within 24 hours.
- When sharing questions, it is suggested to encourage the use of the following structure:
**Topic**: Indicate the topic of your question.
**Question**: Formulate your question clearly and specifically to receive the best possible help.
**Example**:
**Topic**: Data Strategy
**Question**: How is data strategy incorporated to handle the privacy and security of sensitive information during the machine learning lifecycle?

There are two types of mentorship sessions:

# 2. "Office Hours" Mentorship:
- Every Wednesday from 5 pm to 6 pm (Mexico City time) - [Zoom Link](https://wizeline.zoom.us/j/84795494881?pwd=AXlJJbxhxGbY7VItc9Np7vdXC0otGm.1)
- Space where participants can ask our experts questions in the four technical profiles.
- If you are a mentor, check the [office-hour mentoring calendar](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z32aHibMxagGwdzM0aRH0ifQkuUpCbqy6k5kdqq61G8/edit#gid=2042659892)to confirm your attendance.

# 3. On-Demand 1:1 Mentorship:

- Based on their information, we will assign the most suitable mentor by consulting mentor availability via our mentor channel #dsa-coecytjal-mentors.
- Within 24 hours, participants will be notified and sent the link via Google Calendar.
- As a mentor, you'll need to provide feedback on your mentorship via our [mentoring follow-up form](https://forms.gle/oRQb36B9nvWivtbV8). Your comments are crucial for training improvement.
- After your mentoring session, encourage participants to complete the following [mentorship feedback form](https://forms.gle/Ab6Ch6fxQrLGcGDC6).


# VI. Final Projects
The final projects of the training are divided into **two essential parts** to solidify participants' learning and practical application:

**Technical Validation (Individual Project)**:
Participants can **individually** apply the technical knowledge acquired during the training in this phase. They will be assigned a **specific challenge** they must complete as they progress through the topics.
- The information for this validation will be **released** to the participant **starting from Module 3**.

**Business Validation (Group Project)**:
This phase encourages **collaboration and the practical application of skills in a group setting**. Participants will **work together** to address a challenge. This group project will allow them to **integrate their technical knowledge with a strategic and business-oriented vision**.
- The information for this validation will be **released starting from Module 5**.

**The purpose of these final projects is to consolidate participants understanding and skills, providing them with the practical experience necessary to tackle real-world challenges in the field of Machine Learning Operations.**
