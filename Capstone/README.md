# Project Definition
In the technical validation, participants will tackle their own challenges. They will solve a common machine-learning problem using the provided dataset and apply what they have learned in the training.

## Objectives

- Assess their ability to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical context.
- Demonstrate their competence in the topics covered in the program.
- Evaluate their problem-solving skills in real-world scenarios using a dataset.

## Problem Description
In this challenge, participants will dive into exploring a unique dataset. The initial task involves analyzing and thoroughly understanding this information through a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis. The uniqueness of this challenge lies in identifying fundamental reasons that justify it.


# Tasks
- Analyze and understand the provided dataset through Exploratory Data Analysis.
- Determine the question you want to address with a machine learning model.
- Identify why an MLOps strategy is needed for this dataset (Module 1).
- Design the pipeline architecture for this new machine learning initiative.
- Create a baseline model to address prediction tasks (classification, regression, etc.) related to your question. This model doesn't need high accuracy, recall, or F1-Score; the goal is to create a fast model for iteration (Module 4).
- Configure the correct model structure with the idea of making it ready for deployment (Module 6).
- Create new versions of the model, incorporating changes in features or hyperparameter adjustments for reproducibility and experimental tracking (Module 7). Add reproducible and test strategies to be applied to your machine learning pipeline.
- Implement a model in your local environment using containers and plan for retraining, drift, redeployment, scaling, and monitoring (Module 8). Orchestrate and log the machine learning pipeline, and perform the initial deployment.
- Demonstrate testing and versioning strategies (Modules 7 and 8). Evaluate potential drifts that may occur and include monitoring tasks and additional tests to address them.
